                    As the title of this page would indicate, I am not an experienced backpacker. In fact, I've never
                    been, but I want to start and recently I've been spending a lot of my time researching gear.
                    I'm slowly buying gear with each paycheck I receive so I can do my first major hike in May: Mount
                    Whitney. A very expensive online purchase and a few trips to REI later and I now have a sleeping
                    quilt,
                    stakes to a tent I don't own, a pot, and some new merino wool socks.

                    Now, I'm not just trying to become a regular pretentious backpacker, I'm trying to become an
                    extra-pretentious ultralight backpacker. So, what is ultralight backpacking?
                    No official definition of “ultralight” exists. Being "ultralight" is as much a mindset as it is an
                    evolving marketplace.
                    What that means is that there are plenty of methods to go ultralight more minimally than what
                    beginners need,
                    but those items and techniques are generally a better fit for well-seasoned backpackers who know
                    exactly what they want and how to go about doing it.
                    One of the biggest hurdles for beginner backpackers is the thought of carrying a heavy load of gear
                    for many miles over grueling terrain, just to camp somewhere in the backcountry.
                    The amount of effort required seems substantial, especially when considering that many car camping
                    spots are phenomenally beautiful in their own right.
                    After all, if you have a great time at camp but are miserable while lugging a pack for the greater
                    part of a day, then is it really worth it?
                    It's a fair question and deserves a response that isn't crafted by a machismo drive to carry heavy
                    things. And the truth is, carrying excessively heavy loads is a fairly amateurish approach to
                    backpacking.

                    Ultralight is about carrying as much as you need to get fulfillment from all parts of your outdoor
                    experience. While that sentence can be interpreted in two entirely different ways,
                    an emphasis should be placed on the word "need" and how it isn't the word "want". Ultralight is a
                    minimalist perspective on backpacking and about ridding yourself of excess material items
                    in order to experience more of what you actually went out there to see. A good way to look at this
                    is to think of excess wants as being camp luxuries that will unnecessarily make
                    the hiking portion of your journey more burdensome. Many times, people pack for the destination
                    without much consideration of the journey.

            <h3>The Big Three (Four)</h3>
            <p>
                The big three (sometimes seen as the big four) are the essential items you will bring with you on your
                trip. A sleeping bag (or quilt) provides you with warmth and is often considered to be
                the most important item to focus on, as it will keep you away from hypothermia. A tent provides you with
                shelter - this should keep you and your bag dry on a wet night. A pack provides you with mobility.
                The reason this comes third is because a poor quality pack usually causes discomfort whereas a poor
                quality bag or tent can cause a case of actual distress. The fourth item is a sleeping pad for cases
                whenever ground/soil temp drops below 60-65F and the pad becomes necessary insulation.
